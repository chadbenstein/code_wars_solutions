#Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

#If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours!

#Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

def friend(x):
    friend_list = []
    for i in x:
        if len(i) == 4:
            friend_list.append(i)
    return friend_list

friend(["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"]
